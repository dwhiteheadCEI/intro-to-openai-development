I am making a crime mystery game and would like some help. 
The image I am trying to make is of a character in the 1940's, standing in an ornate room inside of a british mansion. 
Make me a picture with the following parameters:

1. The picture should have a sepia filter over it to make it look old fashioned. 
2. The character should be centered in the photo, with plenty of room on each side of her to show off objects and the mansion.
3. The photo should be appropriate for all ages.
4. Include objects in the room behind the character that pertain to their description, but keep it subtle.
5. Add a subtle outline around the character to make them stand out from the background more.
5. The style is realistic, do not be cartoonish.

Here is the character's description:
