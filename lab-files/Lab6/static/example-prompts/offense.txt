Our client is Jack Hargrove, a very rich man who desperately wants our help. Somebody has stolen his family necklace. The necklace is incredibly expensive and has been passed down through many generations. It appears to have been stolen at night. A witness who was at the manor at the time says they heard unexplained footsteps around 2am. Perhaps this could be a clue?
