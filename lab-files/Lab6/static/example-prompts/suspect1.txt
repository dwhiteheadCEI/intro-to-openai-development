The daughter of our client, Jack Hargrove. A formidable titan in the automotive industry as the co-founder and chief operational officer of Vanguard Motors. At fifty-two years of age, she wields her authority with a cold, calculating precision, often seen as ruthless in her pursuit of dominance in the industry. No doubt this came from her father having given her no help in her career. Her ascent from the factory floor to the top echelons of corporate leadership is marked by strategic alliances and fierce competitive tactics that have occasionally blurred ethical lines. Her interactions are sparing and strategic, ensuring each conversation serves her relentless ambition. She is going to be a tough one to speak to candidly, best respect her time, or maybe don't and see what she says when she is uncomfortable.
