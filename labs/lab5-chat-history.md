# Lab 6: Chat History
In this lab, we'll go over one of the most common problems to solve when creating any OpenAI-based solution, chat history. We'll discuss the issue, when it is relevant to our use case as well as strategies for handling the problem and implement a basic chat history that can be run locally and persist between sessions.

## Prerequisites
* An openAI account with credits available
* Basic knowledge of programming in Python
* [VSCode installed](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## A Brief Summation
When working with different LLM-based solutions, a common issue to run into is managing persistent chat history. Chat history is how we can persist context data through multiple messages with our chatbot. 

## Running our App
Let's run our app:
    cd lab-files
    py lab5.py
